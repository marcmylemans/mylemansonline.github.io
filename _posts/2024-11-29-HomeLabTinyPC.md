# How to Build a Quiet and Powerful Home Lab in a Tiny PC  

Have you always wanted to set up a home lab but can’t stand the thought of a noisy server in your closet? Good news—you can build a silent, powerful home lab in a *tiny* PC! In this guide, I’ll show you how to upgrade a compact PC with:  

- **64 GB of RAM**  
- **2 TB of NVMe storage**  
- **A PCI Express riser**  
- **Dual 2.5 Gbit network cards**  

Follow these step-by-step instructions, and you’ll have a home lab that’s both quiet and packed with performance.

## Step 1: Open the Case  

Start by removing the screw at the back of the PC and sliding the case open. You’ll immediately see how compact this system is—it’s incredible how much can fit into such a small design!  

Next, flip the PC upside down and slide open the bottom lid. This gives us access to the memory and storage slots.  

---

## Step 2: Upgrade the RAM  

Locate the RAM slots on the motherboard. Remove the old memory modules by gently pushing the clips on each side.  

Take your new **64 GB RAM kit** and line it up with the slot. The modules are *keyed*, meaning they only fit in one direction. Align them correctly, press down firmly, and you’ll hear a satisfying click when they’re secure.  

---

## Step 3: Install the NVMe Drive  

Now let’s upgrade the storage. Find the NVMe slot on the motherboard and unclip the holder.  

Take your **2 TB NVMe drive** and slide it into the slot. Like the RAM, the NVMe drive has a key to ensure it’s installed correctly. Once it’s in place, secure it with the clip.  

That’s it! You’ve just added lightning-fast storage to your tiny PC.

## Step 4: Install the PCI Riser and Network Card  

Here comes the fun part—installing the **PCI Express riser** and the **dual 2.5 Gbit network card**.  

First, you’ll need to make room by removing the old SATA SSD. Then, take off the backplate by unscrewing the screws—there’s one near the riser slot and another at the back of the PC.  

With the space cleared, insert the PCI riser and slot in the network card. The card will slide into place easily since the PCI slot is also keyed for alignment.  

---

## Step 5: Adjust the Network Card Bracket  

You might notice that the metal bracket on the network card sticks out slightly. While this won’t stop the lid from closing, it doesn’t look great.  

To fix this, remove the bracket by unscrewing the two small screws holding it in place. Once the bracket is off, the card fits flush, giving the PC a much cleaner appearance.  

---

## Step 6: Close the Build  

Finally, slide the lid back into place and secure it with the back screw.  

In just a few simple steps, you’ve transformed your tiny PC into a high-performance home lab with:  

- **64 GB of memory**  
- **2 TB of ultra-fast NVMe storage**  
- **Dual 2.5 Gbit networking**

## Why Build a Compact Home Lab?  

A compact, silent home lab is perfect for anyone looking to:  
- Learn server management or virtualization without noisy hardware.  
- Host personal projects, like file storage or self-hosted apps.  
- Run a lab setup in tight spaces, like a home office or studio.  

With the upgrades in this guide, your tiny PC becomes a powerful and quiet solution for all your home lab needs.
